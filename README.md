About

This application utilizes computer vision techniques to perform face recognition in real-time. It allows users to log in and log out using their face as identification.

Features

- **Real-time Face Detection and Recognition:** Utilizes the webcam to detect and recognize faces in real-time.
- **Attendance Logging:** Logs user attendance with timestamps indicating the time in and time out.
- **User Registration:** Allows for registering new users by capturing their face images and storing their embeddings for future recognition.

Requirements

- Python 3.0
- OpenCV
- face_recognition
- tkinter
- pandas
